# NVS 5.2 Component  
This components has been tested with: **ESP-IDF-Advanced-Template-Alpha-5.2**  

**Expected changes to arrive:**  
None at this time.

The NVS class is just a collection of functions which act as a mid-level abstraction between our objects and low level calls to the IDF.

There are no block diagrams, because NVS is just a collection of functions and very little data.

There are no squences because NVS has no tasks, no run loops, and no sequential processing.

We also have no state models, because NVS does not hold any states internally.  NVS has no controllable lifecycle within the project at this time.
