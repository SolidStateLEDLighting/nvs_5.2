# NVS Flowcharts
___
This NVS object is a mid-level handler for storage.  This object is an extension for any other object that calls to it.

It abstracts away the lower level ESP-IDF functions into a more generalized call.  We have several purposes encapsulated in these functions:

1) If NVS storage does not exist in FLASH, this object will establish it.
2) If any particular value does not exist in NVS, it uses the default value from the caller (by ref) to set the intial value in NVS.  All read and write calls do pass in the default value by reference.
3) All write function calls 'get' before a 'set'.  If those values already equal, another 'set' is does not occur.

This is the Read pattern for boolean values.  Default value is passed in by reference and any retrieved value is passed back by reference.
